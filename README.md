# simple-DNN-from-scratch
We implement here a Deep neural Network from scratch. However, we only use the sigmoid as the activate function, allowing us to express the backpropagation manually. This implementation allows us therefore to make a binary classification for linear input.
The mathematical explanation will be upload soon.
